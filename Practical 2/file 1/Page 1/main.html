                </ul>
                <p>When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a while for me, but I wanted to join my
                    friend for a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and I became reaquainted with the combination of
                    fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda and not so
                    boring as a flavored carbonated water. The Italian sodas at Bytes also have no cream in them (or
                    maybe they do if you ask; I haven't tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop alternative for the
                    times when you're feeling a refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine or milk.

                    <b>Recommendation:</b> Raspberry Italian soda

                </ul>
                <p>Nubz is cafe/bar newly opened in sector 26. The interiors are done well with a mixture of modern age
                    designing with classic old school comfort.
                    The place is divided into three areas basically which is the indoor lounge, the outdoor and rooftop
                    seating.
                    The inner seating area is shady and gives a classic tone to the restaurant where as the outdoor
                    seating is comparatively more modern with Graffiti's and funky wall frames.
                    An ideal place to chill and relax.

                <p>I can't tell you whether CoHo has a particularly amazing Vanilla Bean Latte, only because CoHo is the
                    only place I've ever ordered a Vanilla Bean Latte from. I'm not even totally sure I know what a
                    Vanilla Bean Latte is supposed to taste like. What I do know is the Vanilla Bean Latte I ordered on
                    a whim from CoHo was delicious.

                <p>Nexus Cafe has a lot of tasty things packed into its cafeteria space, including agua fresca! Grab a
                    cup of this fresh and fruity beverage before you head to the check out line. Nexus Cafe has plenty
                    of indoor and outdoor seating, too, so on the next sunny day, take a break on the patio with a cup
                    of agua fresca, and maybe a burrito.
